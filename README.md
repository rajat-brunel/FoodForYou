# Food For You

##Introduction

This group project is based on a food filtering app for the android platform. It will take the location or post code of the user and then
give the user a choice on what type of food they want to get, the user will be able to select a food type , this in turn will show the 
available restaurant offering that kind of food and how far they are, gradually we will add other features like random restaurant and rating.
