=====================================================================

A Group Year 2 Android App project which lets user filter food choices based on location, distance and type of food. Used Scrum methodology for the development of the project.

My Contributions - 

• Produced initial UI prototypes through Proto.io and some Hand designs to make a base to build upon

• Researched Android app development through various books, journals and websites to get started on the coding

• Used GitHub as Version Control to track multiple version of the app and the work done by different members

• Completed the front-end programming, implemented features like GPS, Recycler View, Google Maps API

• Worked on the back-end by setting up a dedicated server with MySQL database, implemented the user registration system and filtering the food options through postcode
